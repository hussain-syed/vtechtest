Before you run the tests

- Tests run on Chrome and FIrefox browsers (so make sure you have both of them with latest version)
- Install Specflow Visual Studio plugin
- Restore Nuget packages
- Clean Solution
- Build the solution
- Run tests using your NUnit Test Runner (I used Resharper's Unit Test)
- To use VS Test Explorer, ensure you have "NUnit Test Adapter" plugin installed in VS
